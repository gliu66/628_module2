# STAT 628 Module 2: Yelp

## Group Member: Guoli Liu, Hongzhi Liu Zong Guo

The goal of this project is to predict stars rating through comment texts and other important information of the Yelp data.

**code** folder: *data_clean.R* contains the code for preliminary data analysis and data cleaning. *model_code.R* contains the code for training the LSTM model and the regression tree, predict final predictions and semantic analysis. We did not upload the data file since they are too large, however, the code will run correctly if you put the *train_data.csv*, *test_val.csv* and the code in the same folder.

**images** folder: contains the plots produced by the code and the images used for the jupyter notebook summary.

*628_module2.ipynb* and *628_module2.pdf* are the summary of our data analysis.
